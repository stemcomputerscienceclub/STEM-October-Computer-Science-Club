# Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide provides steps for successfully deploying the STEM Computer Science Club website to Vercel.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed and up to date
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Check for missing dependencies
   ```
   npm run check:deps
   ```

3. Test the build locally
   ```
   npm run vercel-build
   ```

4. Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured
   - The `CI=false` flag allows the build to continue despite warnings

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI if you don't have it already
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel
   ```
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy the project
   ```
   vercel
   ```

4. For production deployment
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Log in to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select "Import Git Repository" and connect your GitHub account
5. Select the STEM CS Club repository
6. Configure the project settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run vercel-build`
   - Output Directory: `build`
   - Environment Variables: Copy them from your `.env` file

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### GitHub Integration Failures

1. View detailed build logs in Vercel:
   - Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
   - Click on the failed deployment
   - Click "View Build Logs" to see the exact error
   - Look for "Error:" or "Failed:" messages to identify the specific issue

2. Check the Vercel project settings:
   - Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
   - Click "Settings" â†’ "Git Integration"
   - Verify the production branch is set correctly (usually `main` or `master`)
   - Ensure the "Include source files outside of the Root Directory" option is enabled if your project has files in multiple directories

2. Review GitHub Actions:
   - Check if any GitHub Actions are conflicting with Vercel deployments
   - Make sure branch protection rules aren't preventing necessary operations

3. Memory and Build Issues:
   - Vercel's free tier has limitations on build duration and memory
   - Consider splitting your build process into smaller chunks
   - Try setting `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096` in your environment variables
   - For a successful initial deployment, temporarily comment out the 3D background component
   - Once the first deployment succeeds, you can gradually add back complex components

4. Package Management:
   - Make sure your `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` is committed to the repository
   - Try removing `node_modules` from your local project, running a clean install, and then committing

### Build Failures

1. Check Vercel's build logs for specific errors
2. Common issues:
   - Memory limits: Try optimizing heavy components (especially 3D components)
   - TypeScript errors: Set `CI=false` in environment variables (already added to .env)
   - Missing dependencies: Run `npm run check:deps` and install any missing packages

### Runtime Errors

1. Check browser console after deployment
2. If you see 404 errors for routes:
   - Make sure `vercel.json` is correctly configured (it should be now)
   - Verify the "Output Directory" in Vercel settings is set to `build`

### Performance Issues

1. Consider lazy loading heavy components, especially the 3D background:
   ```typescript
   const CS3DBackground = React.lazy(() => import('../components/CS3DBackground'));
   ```

2. Use the analyze script to check bundle size:
   ```
   npm run analyze
   ```
